# Global Factor Models
Tensor Methods applied to the Global VAR data set

I apply a variety of methods to the global VAR data set. This includes lasso, factor models, and tensor decomposition specific for multidimensional data sets. Additionally, valid methods for inference are implemented to analyze variables specific to the Netherlands.
